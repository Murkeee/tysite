              <h4> MUSIC </h4>
              <p> I am a current piano student training in classical music. I only began learning in 2021 but I am currently practising for the ABRSM Grade 4 Piano exam. Although Classical music is my main area of study for the Piano i do listen to a variety of musical genres other than Classical. I also do enjoy the occasional bit of karaoke. You can check out the type of music i usually listen to on my Spotify below.</p>

            <h4> PC BUILDING </h4>
            <p> I sometimes build PCs for myself or friends as a hobby and as paid work. Its very satisfying to see a PC come to life for the first time especially when someone has dumped a truck load of money into it and you're hoping that everything goes well after assembly. I started building PCs when i was 12 so i dont have a picture of all of the PCs i have built but here are some images of the PCs i have built recently for myself and others: (My friends are really bad at taking pictures, sorry) </p>

            I believe my most valuabe trait is my ability to quickly adapt and learn new skills as evident from my piano learning experience in which i have reached ABRSM grade 4 in less than a year. It's also evident from this websites construction as i learnt the relevant languages (HTML and CSS) in just 3 days to create this site.
            I closely identify my current skillset with the saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” As I don’t believe I have yet mastered any one specific talent but do have many. If I could choose one specific skill to master, it would greatly benefit my marketability as an employee. I intend on completing the CompTIA certifications including A+, Network+, and Security+ and the related CISCO certifications including the 'CCNA' once I have graduated from my undergraduate degree to further prove my skills and interest in the IT networking field.

            According to <a href ="https://16personalities.com"><u>16 personalities.com</u></a> my MBTI personality type is ‘ISTP-T’. I dont believe this completely accurately represents my weaknesses but it does a good job of representing my strengths. <a href="https://how-to-study.com"><u>how-to-study.com</u></a> states that my ‘learning style’ is visual and <a href="https://truity.com"><u>truity.com</u></a> states that my work style is 'Humanitarian' and 'Innovator'.
          </p>
          <img style="width: 600px; padding-top: 20px;"src=".\img\MBTI.png">
          <p style="padding-top: 20px">
            Although I believe these tests arent entirely accurate (as I believe one person does not fit entirely into one of the 16 personalities but rather they fit somewhere bewteen two) they can give a good sense of idea on the type of person someone is in the workplace. I believe my results show that I have a positive attitude when it comes to problem solving especially if it's problem solving in a creative way and that like truity.com states, I am driven to make the world a better place using creative solutions and solving problems using analytical skills to improve logical sytsems. I dont believe in the 'learning styles' as I think that its always beneficial to have more than one stream of informaiton when learning something new as such although my outcome for learning styles from how-to-study.com is 'visual' I think that I still benefit greatly from learning styles of all forms. Furthermore, although '16personalities.com' assigned me the introvert trait i do find myself as being somewhere between introverted and extraverted.
